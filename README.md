# Library-Management-System

Developed a Library Management System on asp.net using C# &
SQL (backend) and HTML, CSS, & JavaScript (Frontend). Allows
members to create accounts & issue books from the online library 
by going through the catalogue & offers admin and staff members
the management control of the system.
